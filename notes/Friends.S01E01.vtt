40
00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:28.944
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

41
00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:31.718
Did I say that out loud?

42
00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:37.795
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They took it pretty well.

43
00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:38.987
Oh, really?

44
00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.828
So that hysterical phone call
from a woman sobbing...

45
00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:47.666
..."I'll never have grandchildren,"
was what? A wrong number?

46
00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:48.897
Sorry.

47
00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.909
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

48
00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:55.741
You're angry.
You're hurting.

49
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.179
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

50
00:03:58.352 --> 00:03:59.649
Strip joints!

51
00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:04.188
Hey, you're single.
Have some hormones.

52
00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.589
But I don't want
to be single, okay?

53
00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:11.321
I just want to be married again.

54
00:04:15.502 --> 00:04:19.131
And I just want a million dollars!

55
00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:26.473
-Rachel?
-Oh, Monica! Thank God!

56
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.711
I went to your building...

57
00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:32.648
...and a guy with a hammer
said you'd be here, and you are.

58
00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.721
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

59
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.792
Everybody, this is Rachel,
a Lincoln High survivor.

60
00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:43.588
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe...

61
00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:45.959
...Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?

62
00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:47.360
Sure!

63
00:04:57.277 --> 00:05:01.941
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

64
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.951
Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

65
00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:10.817
I was in the room
with all the presents...

66
00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:16.724
...and I was looking at this
really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

67
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.557
When all of a sudden...

68
00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:19.959
Sweet 'N Low?

69
00:05:22.336 --> 00:05:26.238
I realized I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than Barry.

70
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.307
I got freaked out,
and it hit me:

71
00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.307
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

72
00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.415
I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

73
00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:42.186
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering...

74
00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.052
..."Why am I doing this,"
and "Who am I doing it for?"

75
00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.161
I didn't know where to go,
and I know we've drifted apart...

76
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:53.664
...but you're the only person
I know here.

77
00:05:53.834 --> 00:05:59.204
-Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
-I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.

78
00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.592
I guess he bought her the pipe organ,
and she's really not happy about it.

79
00:06:21.228 --> 00:06:23.822
"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!"

80
00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:30.064
"I'll have whatever
Christina's having."

81
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.569
Daddy, I just...
I can't marry him.

82
00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:38.977
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.

83
00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:43.206
Well, it matters to me!

84
00:06:44.818 --> 00:06:50.347
"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."

85
00:06:51.358 --> 00:06:54.850
She should not be
wearing those pants.

86
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:56.722
Push her down the stairs!

87
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.097
Push her!
Push her down the stairs!

88
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:06.999
Come on, Daddy, listen!

89
00:07:07.607 --> 00:07:11.839
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

90
00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:14.479
"You're a shoe!"

91
00:07:14.648 --> 00:07:17.674
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

92
00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:20.944
What if I want to be a purse?

93
00:07:21.154 --> 00:07:23.782
Or a hat?

94
00:07:24.124 --> 00:07:26.524
No, I don't want you
to buy me a hat!

95
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.025
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

96
00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:34.122
You can see where he'd have trouble.

97
00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:37.766
Look, Daddy,
it's my life.

98
00:07:39.105 --> 00:07:42.700
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

99
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:48.144
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

100
00:07:48.682 --> 00:07:51.947
Well, maybe that's my decision.

101
00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:54.347
Maybe I don't need your money.

102
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:57.754
Wait!
I said maybe!

103
00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:07.832
Just breathe. That's it.

104
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:10.492
Try to think of nice, calm things.

105
00:08:10.804 --> 00:08:14.296
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

106
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:18.905
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

107
00:08:19.746 --> 00:08:23.443
La la la something
And noodles with string

108
00:08:23.984 --> 00:08:25.713
I'm all better now.

109
00:08:27.587 --> 00:08:30.147
I helped.

110
00:08:31.358 --> 00:08:33.758
This is probably for the best.

111
00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:39.192
Independence. Controlling your life.
The whole hat thing.

112
00:08:39.366 --> 00:08:43.496
You can always come to Joey.

113
00:08:43.703 --> 00:08:47.298
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
He's away a lot.

114
00:08:49.109 --> 00:08:51.771
Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

115
00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:55.308
Like there's a rule, or something?

116
00:08:57.417 --> 00:08:59.749
I got it.

117
00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:03.478
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

118
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.314
It's Paul.

119
00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:08.983
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

120
00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:11.630
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

121
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:12.820
Maybe.

122
00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:16.332
Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

123
00:09:16.503 --> 00:09:18.994
-He finally asked you out?
-Yes!

124
00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:21.673
It's a "Dear Diary" moment.

125
00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:25.311
-Rach, I can cancel.
-Please, go, I'll be fine.

126
00:09:26.713 --> 00:09:30.114
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

127
00:09:30.317 --> 00:09:33.013
That'd be good.

128
00:09:34.254 --> 00:09:38.247
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

129
00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:41.055
Does he sell it, drink it?

130
00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:44.025
Or he just complains a lot?

131
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.562
Hi, come in!
Paul, this is...

132
00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:50.292
...everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

133
00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:55.840
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

134
00:09:57.544 --> 00:10:00.672
I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go...

135
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.178
A-wandering?

136
00:10:03.383 --> 00:10:04.714
Change.

137
00:10:04.918 --> 00:10:07.352
Sit down.
Two seconds.

138
00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:15.557
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

139
00:10:19.332 --> 00:10:21.732
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

140
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:26.497
She really likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot...

141
00:10:26.706 --> 00:10:29.539
...until it starts to get red.

142
00:10:29.743 --> 00:10:33.076
Shut up, Joey!

143
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.707
What are you up to tonight?

144
00:10:36.483 --> 00:10:40.214
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

145
00:10:40.487 --> 00:10:42.819
...so, nothing.

146
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.250
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

147
00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:50.396
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?

148
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.928
Talk about your...

149
00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:56.565
...big lizards.

150
00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.935
If you don't want
to be alone tonight...

151
00:11:02.108 --> 00:11:05.669
...Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

152
00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:08.279
We're very excited about it.

153
00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:11.712
Thanks. But I'm just
going to hang out here.

154
00:11:11.918 --> 00:11:13.977
-It's been a long day.
-Oh, sure.

155
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.548
Phoebe, wanna help?

156
00:11:15.989 --> 00:11:19.686
I wish I could,
but I don't want to.

157
00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:33.662
Love is sweet as summer showers
Love is a wondrous work of art

158
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.637
But your love
Oh, your love, your love

159
00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:44.249
Is like a giant pigeon

160
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:48.114
Crapping on my heart

161
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.490
Thank you.

162
00:12:01.167 --> 00:12:05.297
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

163
00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:08.303
...using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

164
00:12:09.743 --> 00:12:14.305
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

165
00:12:14.514 --> 00:12:17.312
...and I cannot feel my legs.

166
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.517
-We got a bookcase.
-It's beautiful.

167
00:12:25.058 --> 00:12:26.423
What's this?

168
00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:31.656
I would have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.

169
00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:36.127
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

170
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:41.302
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

171
00:12:44.544 --> 00:12:47.672
This was Carol's favorite beer.

172
00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:52.517
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

173
00:12:55.955 --> 00:13:01.154
-Start with that, we're out of here.
-Please don't spoil all this fun.

174
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:02.760
Let me ask you.

175
00:13:02.962 --> 00:13:07.296
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

176
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.331
What did you get?

177
00:13:09.536 --> 00:13:12.630
-You guys.
-You got screwed.

178
00:13:12.806 --> 00:13:17.402
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

179
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.172
I should've known when she went to
the dentist five times a week.

180
00:13:22.382 --> 00:13:24.714
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

181
00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:27.250
My brother's going through that.

182
00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:28.977
How did you get over it?

183
00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:32.713
He might accidentally
break something valuable of hers.

184
00:13:32.892 --> 00:13:34.519
-Say her...
-Leg?

185
00:13:34.727 --> 00:13:38.629
That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.

186
00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:41.790
You actually broke her watch?

187
00:13:42.001 --> 00:13:46.233
The worst I ever did was shred
my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

188
00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:50.000
-Steer clear of you.
-That's right.

189
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.579
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

190
00:13:53.847 --> 00:13:59.217
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

191
00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:02.217
It's about me.
And I just...

192
00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:11.787
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

193
00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:21.629
...I know that some lucky girl is going
to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

194
00:14:21.841 --> 00:14:25.572
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

195
00:14:25.778 --> 00:14:30.215
Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but you just...

196
00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:34.243
I'm divorced.

197
00:14:34.454 --> 00:14:41.586
-I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
-Shut up!

198
00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:47.597
That only took me an hour.

199
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:54.836
We haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than a Mento.

200
00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:59.943
You have had the love of a woman
for four years.

201
00:15:00.146 --> 00:15:05.448
Four years of closeness and sharing,
after which she ripped your heart out.

202
00:15:05.652 --> 00:15:08.644
That is why we don't do it!

203
00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:12.991
I don't think that was my point!

204
00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:17.322
Know what's scary? What if there's
only one woman for everybody?

205
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.658
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

206
00:15:20.867 --> 00:15:25.804
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

207
00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:31.073
What are you talking about?
One woman.

208
00:15:31.744 --> 00:15:35.271
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream.

209
00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:39.612
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

210
00:15:39.786 --> 00:15:43.882
Rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

211
00:15:44.724 --> 00:15:49.024
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

212
00:15:49.495 --> 00:15:52.055
It's the best thing
to happen to you!

213
00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:56.099
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?

214
00:15:57.003 --> 00:16:00.905
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

215
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.472
-I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
-Then stay out of my freezer.

216
00:16:09.682 --> 00:16:12.776
Ever since she walked out on me...

217
00:16:13.286 --> 00:16:15.220
What?

218
00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:17.855
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

219
00:16:18.057 --> 00:16:22.790
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

220
00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:27.490
So there's going to be
a fifth date?

221
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.294
Isn't there?

222
00:16:29.502 --> 00:16:31.732
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.

223
00:16:33.406 --> 00:16:36.705
What were you going to say?

224
00:16:40.213 --> 00:16:43.376
Ever since she left me...

225
00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:46.347
...I haven't been able to perform...

226
00:16:47.053 --> 00:16:48.884
...sexually.

227
00:16:51.157 --> 00:16:54.092
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.697
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

229
00:17:00.233 --> 00:17:01.700
How long?

230
00:17:01.901 --> 00:17:04.995
-Two years.
-Wow.

231
00:17:05.204 --> 00:17:09.072
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

232
00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:14.970
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

233
00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:20.714
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

234
00:17:21.254 --> 00:17:26.089
We are gathered here
to join Joanie Louise Cunningham...

235
00:17:26.292 --> 00:17:31.628
...and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi...

236
00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:36.461
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

237
00:17:36.702 --> 00:17:37.760
See!

238
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:43.966
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

239
00:17:44.844 --> 00:17:46.675
"Grab a spoon."

240
00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:50.212
Do you know how long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

241
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.919
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

242
00:17:58.524 --> 00:18:01.618
Great story.
But I gotta go.

243
00:18:01.828 --> 00:18:06.663
I got a date with Andrea.
Angela. No, Andrea.

244
00:18:06.866 --> 00:18:10.267
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

245
00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:15.100
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

246
00:18:16.676 --> 00:18:20.976
Here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough...

247
00:18:21.214 --> 00:18:23.808
...to ask a woman out...

248
00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:25.677
...who am I going to ask?

249
00:18:49.976 --> 00:18:53.605
Isn't this amazing?
I've never made coffee in my life.

250
00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.312
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

251
00:18:56.682 --> 00:19:00.413
If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

252
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.151
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
there's nothing I can't do."

253
00:19:06.325 --> 00:19:10.989
If you feel like you have to make
a Western omelet or something...

254
00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:17.391
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

255
00:19:18.604 --> 00:19:22.040
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

256
00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:24.601
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

257
00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:28.479
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

258
00:19:28.814 --> 00:19:31.647
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

259
00:19:38.691 --> 00:19:41.660
-Thank you so much.
-Stop.

260
00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:46.355
Last night was like
all my birthdays, both graduations...

261
00:19:46.566 --> 00:19:49.091
...plus the barn-raising scene
in Witness.

262
00:19:55.007 --> 00:19:56.406
We'll talk later.

263
00:20:01.647 --> 00:20:03.342
Thank you.

264
00:20:10.423 --> 00:20:13.722
That wasn't a real date.

265
00:20:13.926 --> 00:20:17.157
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

266
00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:21.189
Shut up and put my table back.

267
00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:23.767
I've got to get to work.

268
00:20:23.936 --> 00:20:29.465
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

269
00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:35.105
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

270
00:20:36.349 --> 00:20:40.911
Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.

271
00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:47.185
-Yeah, I'm an actor.
-Have I seen you in anything?

272
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.726
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

273
00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:53.387
Unless you saw the Wee One's
production of Pinocchio...

274
00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:56.397
...at the little theater
in the park?

275
00:20:56.802 --> 00:20:58.133
It was a job!

276
00:20:58.504 --> 00:21:01.132
"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy."

277
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:07.675
-I will not take this abuse.
-You're right, I'm sorry.

278
00:21:07.947 --> 00:21:10.609
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

279
00:21:13.052 --> 00:21:17.250
You should both know
that he's a dead man.

280
00:21:17.423 --> 00:21:19.391
Oh, Chandler!

281
00:21:21.827 --> 00:21:24.125
How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?

282
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.232
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

283
00:21:28.434 --> 00:21:32.962
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

284
00:21:37.643 --> 00:21:40.771
I know.
He's just so...

285
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.010
-Remember you and Tony Demarco?
-Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:44.216 --> 00:21:47.947
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

287
00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:51.790
-Wow, are you in trouble!
-Big time!

288
00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:55.556
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

289
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:59.322
I think we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves.

290
00:21:59.532 --> 00:22:04.162
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

291
00:22:05.104 --> 00:22:08.005
Or else I'm going to get up
and go to work.

292
00:22:08.207 --> 00:22:09.868
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

293
00:22:10.042 --> 00:22:14.445
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

294
00:22:24.623 --> 00:22:27.057
-Hi, Monica.
-Franny, welcome back.

295
00:22:27.293 --> 00:22:30.456
-How was Florida?
-You had sex, didn't you?

296
00:22:32.498 --> 00:22:34.728
-How do you do that?
-I hate you.

297
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.927
I'm pushing my aunt through
Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

298
00:22:39.105 --> 00:22:42.268
So, who?

299
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:44.131
You know Paul?

300
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.777
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.

301
00:22:50.316 --> 00:22:52.841
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

302
00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:55.111
What?
I take credit for Paul.

303
00:22:55.321 --> 00:22:59.621
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

304
00:23:02.895 --> 00:23:05.455
Of course it was a line.

305
00:23:05.798 --> 00:23:08.528
Why would anybody
do something like that?

306
00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:11.966
I assume we want an answer
more sophisticated than:

307
00:23:12.138 --> 00:23:15.073
"To get you into bed."

308
00:23:15.274 --> 00:23:17.606
I hate men.

309
00:23:17.777 --> 00:23:21.907
Don't hate. You don't want
to put that out into the universe.

310
00:23:22.214 --> 00:23:23.545
Is it me?

311
00:23:23.816 --> 00:23:27.445
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

312
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.316
...and men with emotional problems
can hear?

313
00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:33.788
Come here.
Give me your feet.

314
00:23:40.032 --> 00:23:43.024
I just thought he was nice, you know?

315
00:23:46.272 --> 00:23:50.333
I can't believe
you didn't know it was a line.

316
00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:55.611
-Guess what?
-You got a job?

317
00:23:55.781 --> 00:24:00.081
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.

318
00:24:00.352 --> 00:24:04.311
-I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
-You're surprisingly upbeat.

319
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.755
You'd be too,
if you found these boots on sale...

320
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.951
...50% off.

321
00:24:10.129 --> 00:24:13.189
How well you know me.

322
00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:16.858
They're my
"I don't need a job...

323
00:24:17.069 --> 00:24:19.128
...I've got great boots" boots.

324
00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:22.734
-How did you pay?
-Credit card.

325
00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:25.937
And who pays for that?

326
00:24:26.212 --> 00:24:28.942
My father.

327
00:24:31.717 --> 00:24:35.244
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.

328
00:24:35.454 --> 00:24:37.684
You can't live off your parents.

329
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.621
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

330
00:24:42.294 --> 00:24:45.422
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.

331
00:24:45.664 --> 00:24:46.653
Thank you.

332
00:24:46.832 --> 00:24:50.359
I remember when I first
came to this city, I was 14.

333
00:24:50.569 --> 00:24:53.436
Mom had killed herself,
stepdad was in jail.

334
00:24:53.639 --> 00:24:55.664
I didn't know anybody here.

335
00:24:55.875 --> 00:25:00.471
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

336
00:25:00.679 --> 00:25:02.476
And then he killed himself.

337
00:25:02.681 --> 00:25:07.345
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.

338
00:25:10.656 --> 00:25:13.250
The word you're looking for is:

339
00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:16.360
"Anyway..."

340
00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:24.132
-You ready?
-No, how can I be ready?

341
00:25:24.303 --> 00:25:27.204
"Ready to jump out of the plane
with no parachute?"

342
00:25:27.373 --> 00:25:29.603
-I can't do this.
-I know you can.

343
00:25:29.808 --> 00:25:32.902
-No.
-You made coffee, you can do anything.

344
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:38.416
Cut. Cut. Cut.

345
00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:47.083
You know what?
I think we can leave it at that.

346
00:25:47.293 --> 00:25:51.354
-Kind of a symbolic gesture.
-Rachel, that was a library card.

347
00:25:58.037 --> 00:26:02.906
If you listen closely, you can hear
a thousand retailers scream.

348
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:07.772
Welcome to the real world!

349
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.211
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

350
00:26:19.124 --> 00:26:22.184
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?

351
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:26.525
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

352
00:26:28.334 --> 00:26:31.667
Look what I just
found on the floor.

353
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:34.095
What?

354
00:26:34.306 --> 00:26:38.037
That's Paul's watch.
Just put it back where you found it.

355
00:26:39.712 --> 00:26:41.873
Oh, boy!
All right.

356
00:26:42.314 --> 00:26:45.647
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

357
00:26:55.694 --> 00:27:00.597
-I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
-Split it?

358
00:27:04.837 --> 00:27:08.295
You probably didn't know this,
but in high school...

359
00:27:08.674 --> 00:27:11.165
...I had a major crush on you.

360
00:27:12.478 --> 00:27:13.843
I knew.

361
00:27:14.013 --> 00:27:17.073
You did?

362
00:27:17.349 --> 00:27:20.876
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

363
00:27:21.086 --> 00:27:23.145
I did.

364
00:27:27.793 --> 00:27:29.385
Listen, do you think...?

365
00:27:29.595 --> 00:27:34.589
Try not to let my vulnerability
become a factor here.

366
00:27:35.234 --> 00:27:39.364
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

367
00:27:40.272 --> 00:27:42.433
Yeah.

368
00:27:42.641 --> 00:27:43.972
Maybe.

369
00:27:44.877 --> 00:27:48.176
Okay.

370
00:27:51.583 --> 00:27:53.517
Okay, maybe I will.

371
00:27:57.856 --> 00:28:01.257
-Good night.
-Good night.

372
00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:16.569
See you.

373
00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:20.367
Wait, wait.
What's with you?

374
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:27.281
I just grabbed a spoon.

375
00:28:33.392 --> 00:28:37.556
-I can't believe what I'm hearing.
-Can't believe what I'm hearing

376
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.960
-What? I said...
-What? I said...

377
00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:43.491
-Would you stop?
-Was I doing it again?

378
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:45.967
Yes!

379
00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:50.708
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

380
00:28:50.876 --> 00:28:55.108
-You won't know a butt if it bit you.
-There's an image.

381
00:28:57.583 --> 00:29:00.848
Would anybody like more coffee?

382
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.050
You made it,
or you're serving it?

383
00:29:04.256 --> 00:29:07.851
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

384
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.527
Kids, new dream.

385
00:29:09.695 --> 00:29:10.957
I'm in Las Vegas.

386
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.758
Miss, more coffee?

387
00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:17.897
Could you give this
to that guy over there?

388
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.234
Go ahead.
Thank you.

389
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.170
Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.

390
00:29:24.376 --> 00:29:26.469
I'm in Las Vegas.

391
00:29:27.379 --> 00:29:29.745
I'm Liza Minnelli...
